# UFOs
### Overview of Project:
#### The purpose of this project was to be able to take some data and create and format that anyone could use. In this case the goal was to take data about UFo's and put it into a format that anyone could use and filter certain data. If someone was looking for UFO sighting for a certain date they were able to using the code that was created.
### Results:
#### This webpage would be perfect for someone trying to see if there are any UFO sighting near them they would need to fill out the data boxes asking for country, state, and city. If they just wanted to see any UFO sighting for just a state they would just type what state they wanted to check in the appropaiate box and hit enter. Then would update the code to look only for data that has that state and show it to the user. But before any filters are inputed, all of the data is presented and to bring back the original unfiltered data the user could just refresh the page.
#### This is an example of the unfiltered data on the webpage. Looking at the filter bar, there are example for the user to use to help them imput their own data correctly.

#### This is an example of data that has been filtered. In this instance the user only wanted to see data that had the shape circle.

### Summary:
* #### One drawback of this page is that when the user originally goes to the page there is a lot of data so they have to scroll through it to see it all. Once the data is filtered there is less but it can be a lot at first.
* #### I think it would be useful to have the data table be multiple page so that it may be less confusing and for there to be a count of the records. Additionally, I think it would be good to filter down the data more and only show certain columns. for example, if the user only wanted to see data had the shape circle but also just wants to see the city and state and not the rest of the columns such as duration.
